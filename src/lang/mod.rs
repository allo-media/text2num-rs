# How to add support for a new language

The idea behind the decoding of numbers in natural language, is to consider that numbers represents
a subset of the language that is "simple" and consistent enough to be interpreted like a an arithmetic computer language.

A number expressed in words is then seen as a little program whose interpretation result is either a sequence of digits, if the number is valid, or an
error.

The common runtime for all interpretors is the [`DigitString`]. It provided the memory
and the elementary functions to build a number in base 10 (even if the language to be interpreted counts otherwise).
The `DigitString` is responsible for checking the validity of the constructed number at each step (i.e at each method call).

The intepretor part, which is specific to each language, is built by implementing the `LangInterpretor` trait, which
translate each number word into a sequence of elementary instructions on a `DigitString`.

A language is just an empty (stateless) type. Everything is provided by implementating the trait.

Look at the source of the builtin languages as examples.
